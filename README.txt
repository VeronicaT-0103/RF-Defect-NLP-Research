# RF Defect Detection using NLP

This project demonstrates an AI-based system for identifying RF signal defects
using natural language processing and simulated hardware inputs.

## Overview
The system integrates RF signal analysis with an NLP model to diagnose
signal-related issues based on measurement descriptions.

## Features
- RF signal analysis simulation
- NLP-based defect classification
- Hardware interaction abstraction
- End-to-end demo execution

## How to Run
```bash
python system_demo.py
